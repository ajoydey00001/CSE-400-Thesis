# BSSpell
Bangla remains a low-resource language in NLP,
with frequent spelling errors due to its complex script and
reliance on English keyboards. Correcting misspelled words
requires understanding both typing patterns and contextual
meaning, making it a challenging research area. This paper
introduces BSSpell, a monolingual transformer-based model for
sentence-level spelling correction, enhanced through Knowledge
Distillation from BGEC. Experiments show that BSSpell outperforms existing methods, achieving 97.02% accuracy
